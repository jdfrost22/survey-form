# survey-form
## Example of a Survey
This is an example of a survey about a certain topic that would be collected by community members.
I will try and include a number of different types of inputs.
I wanted to try and create a page that would have a use and purpose and give me practice in creating forms. I also want to practice some styling in CSS.
